As you load the main page, the default value of the `date input` will be the current day the user is viewing the page. The date can be changed depending on the user's preference and the photo and explanation of the desired A.P.O.D. will be shown once the user hits the search button. Below the description, is the `Add to favorites` button where the user is able to save the A.P.O.D. if desired. The user has the ability to view the saved set of A.P.O.D. below the current A.P.O.D. and will be able to remove (Trash button) it if he/she doesn't like the certain A.P.O.D. anymore.
