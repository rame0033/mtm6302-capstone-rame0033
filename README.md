### NASA A.P.O.D. UI 
View PDF [here](./gian-ramelb-apod-mockup.pdf)

As you load the main page, the default value of the `date input` will be the current day the user is viewing the page. The date can be changed depending on the user's preference and the photo and explanation of the desired A.P.O.D. will be shown once the user hits the search button. The main picture is clickable and be able to view it in full screen.Below the description, is the `Add to favorites` button where the user is able to save the A.P.O.D. if desired. The user has the ability to view the saved set of A.P.O.D. below the current A.P.O.D. and will be able to remove (Trash button) it if he/she doesn't like the certain A.P.O.D. anymore.


### Report

- I have built an initial HTML with the following elements:
1. Input
2. Button (Search, Favorites, and Delete)
3. Main img element
4. Heading elements
5. Main `<p>` element
6. List item that contains the marked as favorite image.

- Stylings have been applied. Highlight is that I used flex-wrap for the favorites container to easily contain the items and make it responsive.

- Challenges have been encountered especially when doing the styles for the application. So what I did is to add placeholders for the mean time. This helped me to set proper height and width specifically for images and the 'favorites' item card.
